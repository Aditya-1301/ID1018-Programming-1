# Mandatory Assignments

Here I provide a small description of each Mandatory Assignment and I have provided the assignment pdf for each assignment in it's respective directory as well if someone is interested in more information.

## Assignment 1

### Logic and Vectors
- Temperature readings are collected at the same location over a few weeks.
- Readings are taken regularly, with an equal number of readings each week.

### Incomplete Solution
The provided program reads and displays the temperature readings. It then computes and stores the minimum, maximum, and average temperature for each week, and prints these results. Finally, it calculates and prints the minimum, maximum, and average temperature for the entire measurement period.

## Assignment 2

### Computation on a Triangle

To determine the properties of a triangle, such as side lengths, angles, circumcircle, and incircle, mathematical formulas can be used. By creating a class called Triangle with static methods, computations on triangle properties can be simplified. The Triangle class can contain methods for calculating area, circumference, bisectors, and more. 

Exercises on a Triangle:

- Create the Triangle class with static methods for computing triangle properties.
- Implement a method to calculate the length of a bisector based on two sides and the angle between them.
- Create a program called TriangleAndItsCircles to calculate the radii of the circumcircle and incircle using Triangle class methods.
- Draw a triangle with given side lengths and measure the radii of the circumcircle and incircle to verify the program's output.
